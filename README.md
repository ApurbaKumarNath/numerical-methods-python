# Foundations of Numerical Methods in Python

[![View Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/View-Live_Demo-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://apurbakumarnath.github.io/numerical-methods-python/)

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that explore and implement fundamental numerical methods from the ground up. Each notebook is designed to be a self-contained guide, combining the underlying theory with practical Python code.

The primary libraries used are **NumPy** for numerical operations, **Pandas** for data presentation, and **Matplotlib** for visualization.

## Philosophy

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a clear understanding of how these powerful algorithms work. Each topical notebook is structured in two parts:

1.  **Theory:** A detailed explanation of the mathematical concepts, formulas, and logic behind the method.
2.  **Implementation:** A from-scratch Python implementation of the algorithm, often accompanied by examples and visualizations to verify the results.

This approach aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

## The Numerical Methods Cookbook

The **[Numerical_Methods_Cookbook.ipynb](./Numerical_Methods_Cookbook.ipynb)** in the root directory serves as a practical, hands-on companion to the more theoretical notebooks. It is structured in two distinct phases to demonstrate both foundational understanding and flexible problem-solving.

1.  **Phase 1: Core Logic, Unwrapped**
    This section strips away the complexity of classes and functions to present the core algorithmic logic of each method in its purest form. Using only fundamental loops and NumPy array operations, these from-scratch implementations are perfect for understanding the step-by-step process of methods like Vandermonde, Lagrange, and Newton's Divided Difference without the overhead of object-oriented design.

2.  **Phase 2: Algorithmic Puzzles & Analytical Thinking**
    Moving beyond direct implementation, this phase treats numerical methods as problem-solving puzzles. It features modified versions of the standard algorithms, designed to test a more flexible and robust understanding. In some cases, a solution is provided, challenging the reader to deduce the original problem statementâ€”simulating a reverse-engineering and analytical thinking exercise. This section showcases the ability to adapt foundational knowledge to non-standard scenarios, a crucial skill in any applied engineering or data science role.
