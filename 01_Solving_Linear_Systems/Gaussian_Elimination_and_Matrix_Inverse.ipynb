    "## Part 1: Solving a Linear System Using the Inverse Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concept\n",
    "A system of $n$ linear equations with $n$ variables can be represented in matrix form as:\n",
    "$$ Ax = b $$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- **A** is an $n \\times n$ square matrix of the coefficients.\n",
    "- **x** is an $n \\times 1$ column vector of the unknown variables.\n",
    "- **b** is an $n \\times 1$ column vector of the constant terms on the right-hand side.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution Method\n",
    "If the matrix **A** is **non-singular**, it has a unique inverse, denoted as **A⁻¹**. A matrix is non-singular if and only if its determinant is non-zero (`det(A) ≠ 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution vector **x** can be found by pre-multiplying both sides of the equation by **A⁻¹**:\n",
    "$$ A^{-1}Ax = A^{-1}b $$\n",
    "Since $A^{-1}A = I$ (the identity matrix), the equation simplifies to:\n",
    "$$ x = A^{-1}b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "While conceptually simple, this method has practical drawbacks:\n",
    "1.  **Computational Cost:** Calculating the inverse of a matrix is a computationally intensive process, especially for large matrices.\n",
    "2.  **Numerical Instability:** For matrices that are \"ill-conditioned\" (nearly singular), this method can lead to large numerical errors in the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, while it is a valid theoretical approach, it is often less preferred in practice compared to methods like Gaussian Elimination."

    "## Part 2: Solving a Linear System Using Gaussian Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concept\n",
    "Gaussian Elimination is a systematic algorithm for solving systems of linear equations by transforming the original system `Ax = b` into an equivalent, but much simpler, **upper triangular system** `Ux = y`. This new system can then be easily solved without computing a matrix inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation is achieved using **elementary row operations**:\n",
    "1.  Adding a multiple of one row to another.\n",
    "2.  Swapping two rows (Pivoting - an important extension, not required by this lab's core task).\n",
    "3.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are performed on an **augmented matrix** `[A|b]`, which is the `A` matrix with the `b` vector appended as an extra column. This ensures that the operations are applied to both `A` and `b` simultaneously, preserving the solution `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Algorithm: A Two-Step Process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Forward Elimination**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main phase where we introduce zeros below the main diagonal to create the upper triangular matrix `U`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Goal:** For each column `k` from `0` to `n-2`, we want to make all elements below the diagonal element `A[k,k]` equal to zero.\n",
    "-   **Process for column `k`:**\n",
    "    1.  The row `k` is the **pivot row**, and `A[k,k]` is the **pivot element**.\n",
    "    2.  For each row `i` below the pivot row (i.e., `i > k`):\n",
    "        a. Calculate a **multiplier**: `m = A[i, k] / A[k, k]`.\n",
    "        b. Update the entire row `i` with the operation: `Row_i = Row_i - m * Row_k`.\n",
    "-   **Result:** After iterating through all columns, the original augmented matrix `[A|b]` is transformed into `[U|y]`, where `U` is upper triangular.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Backward Substitution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the system is in the simple form `Ux = y`, we can solve for the variables starting from the bottom up.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Goal:** Find the values of $x_n, x_{n-1}, \\dots, x_1$.\n",
    "-   **Process:**\n",
    "    1.  The last equation in the system is `U[n-1, n-1] * x[n-1] = y[n-1]`. We can solve this directly for the last variable:\n",
    "        $$ x_{n-1} = \\frac{y_{n-1}}{U_{n-1, n-1}} $$\n",
    "    2.  The second-to-last equation is `U[n-2, n-2] * x[n-2] + U[n-2, n-1] * x[n-1] = y[n-2]`. Since we now know $x_{n-1}$, we can plug it in and solve for $x_{n-2}$.\n",
    "    3.  This process is repeated, working backwards up the matrix. The general formula is:\n",
    "        $$ x_j = \\frac{1}{U_{j,j}} \\left( y_j - \\sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} U_{j,k} x_k \\right) $$\n",
    "        for $j = n-2, \\dots, 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two-step process is more numerically stable and computationally efficient for large systems than the inverse matrix method."
